# giphy-page

This superhero themed website pulls 10 GIFs from the GIPHY API of the superhero buttons at the top of the page.

The option to have the user add their own hero is added, turning their input into a clickable button that searches the API for their hero, and returns the top 10 matches.

A fun, optional (yet incredibly appropriate) music track by Bonnie Tyler is added.

Each GIF appears as a still image, and when clicked, starts playing. If the GIF is in a play state, clicking again will stop play.
